EC2:
=======================
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy 
applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure 
security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in 
requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

EC2 Container service:
=======================
Use to run docker container and scale 
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that 
makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless 
infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type.
For more control you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances 
that you manage by using the EC2 launch type.
Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the 
state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.

Elastic beanstalk:
==================
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about 
the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without 
restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles 
the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

Lambda:
===============
AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands
per second. 

Amazon Lightsail:
==================
Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers. 
Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage,
data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail
servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).

AWS Batch: (what is batch --> Batch processing is a general term used for frequently used programs that are 
executed with minimum human interaction)
============================================
AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for
developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the 
undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure, similar to traditional
batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in 
order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.
