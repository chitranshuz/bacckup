Connection points
============================


AWS > REGION ---> AVAILABILITY ZONE -----> DATA CENTER ------> EDGE LOCATION 


1.AWS regions -
An Amazon AWS region is a physical location spread across globe to host your data to reduce latency. In each region
there will be at least two availability zones for fault tolerance.

2.Availability zone -
An AZ is a combination of one or more data centers in a given region. These datacenters need not to be separated by
 multiple kilometers physically but by meters with in a physical compound which are completely isolated from each 
other failure such as power, network in a given AZ.  It is a logical grouping of data centers in a given region 
for service high availability. These AZs in a region are connected with direct Fiber optic links which have 
capacity of around 25Tbps bandwidth and a latency of 2ms to 1ms. Below list shows availability zones in given 
regions.

3.data center -
A datacenter is a location where actual physical data resides. 

4.Edge location -
An edge location is where end users access services located at AWS. They are located in most of the major cities 
around the world and are specifically used by CloudFront (CDN) to distribute content to end user to reduce 
latency. It is like frontend for the service we access which are located in AWS cloud.

5.origin -
this is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute.this can be either an s3 bucket,an ec2 instance ,
an elastic load balancer or route53.
