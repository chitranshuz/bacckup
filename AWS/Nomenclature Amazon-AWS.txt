The pattern is that utility services are prefixed with AWS, while standalone services are prefixed by "Amazon".

Services prefixed with AWS typically use other services, for example:

• AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks and AWS CloudFormation launch other services

• AWS Lambda is triggered by other services

• AWS Data Pipeline moves data between other services

• AWS CloudFormation launches other services
