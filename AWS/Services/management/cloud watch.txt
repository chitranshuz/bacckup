cloud watch
===================

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real 
time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources 
and applications.

The CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service you use. You can additionally 
create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications, and display custom collections of 
metrics that you choose.

You can create alarms which watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources 
you are monitoring when a threshold is breached. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and 
writes of your Amazon EC2 instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional 
instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.

With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and 
operational health.
