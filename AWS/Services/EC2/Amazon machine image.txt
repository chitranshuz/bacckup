Amazon machine image 

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server 
in the cloud. You must specify a source AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a
 single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch 
instances when you need instances with different configurations.
