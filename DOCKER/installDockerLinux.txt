INSTALL DOCKER ON LINUX-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.three main ways to install docker on linux are: script, store, or docker-machine.

Setting up docker and also install--------http://store.docker.com------------------------------

1.we can go to the above link and install the docker version needed like for ubuntu 16.04 or we can go to (http;//
get.docker.com) for the script to install docker which is automated.(just need to copy paste).

                       curl -fsSl get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
after that docker is install in the machine and we can use it using sudo in prefix but another way is to give 
docker root permission by adding it into docker group(this can be done not needed if we have security issuses).

check if docker is installed by --- sudo docker version

2.After installing docker we need 2 other tools "machine" and "compose".(http://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/)
after installing machine check -- docker-machine version 
and same with docker compose.(http://github.com/docker/compose/releases).new releases can be found here.
check docker-compose version.
