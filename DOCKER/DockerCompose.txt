Docker compose---------------doc .docker .com

docker compose comprised of 2 separate but related things
1. YAML-formatted file 
2. a cli tool docker-compose 


Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

1.Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.

2.Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.

3.Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire app.
