images vs containers ---------------------

1.an image is an application we want to run.
2.a container is an instance of that image running as a process.
3.many container run the same image.
4.docker default image "registry" is called docker hub. (hub.docker.com).

$ docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

we can also use 

$ docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx it will run it in background.

to list running containers 
$docker container ls

stop conatiners
$ docker container stop <container  ID>

$docker conatiner ls -a   list containers in machine if running or not does't matters.

we can define the name of container 
$ dcoker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name <anyName> nginx

to see logs of any container 
$ docker container logs <container name>

$ docker container --help to see all cmd we can use

to remove container
$ docker container rm <container ID> can also use -f after rm to force remove



what happens when we run container---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Look for the image locally in image cache 
2.then look in image repo aka Docker hub.
3.download latest version
4.create new container based on thet image.
5.gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine.
6.open up port 80 on host and forword to port 80 in container.
7.start container using CMD in the image Dockerfile.
